# Minimalistic, yet fully-featured Vuex example

A Work-in-Progress by @gbezyuk

This branch cointains some incrementably adoptable standalone Vue examples.

See tags: @step0, @step0.1, @step1 —  and so on.

We start with a simple HTML-embedded example, and gradually move to a fully-functional WebPack-based application.

You will need some sort of static HTTP server to run some of the examples. You could use `http-server`:

```bash
# installation
npm install -g http-server
# run it with caching disabled
http-server -c-1
```
